In this book there are lots of powerful rings, but only "One Ring" can control all of them and it is the most powerful ring. So there are lots of great teams but, most creative and simple is ours. Why simple? Our Website, Name and Logo are simple, because great powers don't need to tell something about their powers. "One Ring" also simple, but it is the greates. So we thought simple = power, and made everything simple.</div>
